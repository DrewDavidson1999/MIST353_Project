# SampleProject

OverView

This project is a weather data website tailored for farmers, offering real-time and long-term weather forecasts, historical weather trends, and farm management tips. 
The website's core functionality includes a U.S. weather map that allows users to search by location and access data specific to their region. 
The platform is designed to assist farmers in making informed decisions about crop management, planting, and harvesting by leveraging accurate, localized weather information.
The homepage will have a quick search of for your location and give quick data for the week. -Drew
The historical page will show records by region with visual graphs or charts -Joey
The seasonal page will show long term forcasts with monitoring of different data for farmers. -Nathan
The farm tips will allow users to show specific recommendations and other links. -Sami

Current Phase: The project is in the initial development phase, where the core structure of the website is being built.
Key features under development include the interactive weather map, a system for querying real-time and historical data, and basic visualizations for trends. 
The front-end design is focused on usability and mobile-friendliness, while the back-end is setting up data fetching mechanisms from weather APIs.

Future Enhancements
Mobile Optimization: Improve the interface for better mobile usability, allowing farmers to access weather data on the go.
User Accounts: Enable user profiles to save locations, set weather alerts, and receive personalized recommendations.
Advanced Visualizations: Add interactive charts and graphs for more in-depth data analysis.
Enhanced API Integration: Incorporate multiple weather APIs for more detailed, localized weather data.

**Competitive Analysis**: 
For my competitive analysis I analyzed the website OpenWeather (openweathermap.org/). Upon inspecting the website I found the HTML code for the implementation of a hamburger menu. 
First by creating a list item with the ID set to hamburger (<li id=”hamburger”>). Following sourcing the image for the hamburger menu (<img src = “link” alt = “icon hamburger”>. 
I found very useful HTML code to help me understand how to format a menu. The HTML code used to link a website and or specific page to a list item in building the menu was specifically redirecting users to other pages of their website. 
Often instead of using the whole URL for the hyperlink, the developer used for example, “/guide or /API”. The logo of the website is referenced as a hyperlink to reverent the user back to the home screen. 
When clicking on the logo instead of referencing a specific page of the website it references the source of the logo image.

**GitHub Repository Research**:
For my repository research I analyzed the GitHub repository (github.com/BondeYash), who created a similar weather application. One key takeaway from his repository is his HTML code to implement a drop down window. 
This is a great concept for my group to add to our project, to help navigate through different pages of our application. Another area of code that I found interesting is creating card classes to display different categories of weather, such as wind, temperature, and humanity information. 
My group could use this idea to implement weather cards that display with such information, after the user searches for their location of interest. Upon researching different GitHub repositories for similar concepts to my group's weather application, it was difficult to find a detailed README.md file. 

**Documenting Individual Contributions**
I created the WeatherDataHomePage.cshtml page of our prototype. For my WeatherDataHomePage I implemented a backround image for the web page based off farm landscape. Following I created a bold header for the top of the page reading "Weather for Farmers".
Directly below my <h1> I added a second header with text directing the user to "Search for weather conditions below!", I added a seagreen backround to the text. Next I added a card to hold the search bar for users to search for weather by their city name.
Next I added a card to hold hypothetical weather data from a certain location, in the future the goal is to have the user find their current location when accessing website, then the weather data will autoload into this card. 
Next I added a "find my location" button for the user to find their current location based of longitude and latitude, I am still trying to attempt to have the location of the user displayed by name of their city. I made the all the text yellow pertaining to the get your location button.

**Research and Findings**
For this project I researched multiple repositories, I found ways to implement search bars that look more aestheticly pleasing, instead of carrying a 90's look. As well make the button for the searh bar to have a cleaner design.
Additionally I found a method to implement the "get your location" feature. This is to fetch the users current location, I was only able to find examples of cordinate locations, I am still working on getting location to appear as a city. 
Reguarding researching a website I chose a weather data based website, during inspecting the HTML code of this website I learned a lot of useful information. First I found a section of HTML code for making a hamburger menu, and implemeting list items into the menu utilizing href to direct the user to other pages of the site. 
Additionally I discovered how to utilize the logo theme of a website as a list item with a correlated theme hyperlink to redirect the user to the home screen. 

**Reflection on Resources**
For this assignment the resources that I used included Github repositories, W3Schools, ChatGPT, and inspecting website for their HTML code. I found inspecting websites and GitHub repositories to be the most helpful resource during this assignment. I feel inspecting a website is one of the most beneficial ways to learn HTML, following along with the code displayed and the layout of the website.
I did not use ChatGPT to write me code from scratch, I feel that ChatGPT has flawed methods of coding that results in errors. I did use ChatGPT to help me revise code that I had, such as look for errors or revise code that was not working correctly. 
W3Schools was very helpful in understanding core HTML concepts, format, and finding information for any questions that I had.
