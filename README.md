This project is a weather data website tailored for farmers, offering real-time and long-term weather forecasts, historical weather trends, and farm management tips. 
The website's core functionality includes a U.S. weather map that allows users to search by location and access data specific to their region. 
The platform is designed to assist farmers in making informed decisions about crop management, planting, and harvesting by leveraging accurate, localized weather information.
The homepage will have a quick search of for your location and give quick data for the week. -Drew
The historical page will show records by region with visual graphs or charts -Joey
The seasonal page will show long term forecasts with monitoring of different data for farmers. -Nathan
The farm tips will allow users to show specific recommendations and other links. -Sami

Current Phase: The project is in the initial development phase, where the core structure of the website is being built.
Key features under development include the interactive weather map, a system for querying real-time and historical data, and basic visualizations for trends. 
The front-end design is focused on usability and mobile-friendliness, while the back-end is setting up data fetching mechanisms from weather APIs.

Future Enhancements
Mobile Optimization: Improve the interface for better mobile usability, allowing farmers to access weather data on the go.
User Accounts: Enable user profiles to save locations, set weather alerts, and receive personalized recommendations.
Advanced Visualizations: Add interactive charts and graphs for more in-depth data analysis.
Enhanced API Integration: Incorporate multiple weather APIs for more detailed, localized weather data.

Farmer Weather has an interactive radar map that I would like to implement on my page. I think having this on the page would definitely make the page look better.
When creating a website like this, we are obviously expecting people from all over the United States to use it, so having a radar map of the entire USA would allow for anyone anywhere to quickly see radar for their area.
After looking at the radar map, they would then be able to see the weather data for their specific state/region.
