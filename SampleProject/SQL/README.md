# **Company Statement**
At our company Weather Data for Farmers, we are working to combine our front-end code using HTML and JavaScript with our back-end code in SQL Server to build a user-friendly web application. Our plan is to integrate our weather databases with a simple interface that allows farmers to access real-time weather forecasts, view historical weather trends, and manage their preferred locations for weather data. Our goal is to create a web application tool that allows farmers to make informed decisions, to help improve their day-to-day operations and crop management.
